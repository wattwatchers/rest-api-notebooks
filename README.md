# Jupyter Notebooks for the Wattwatchers REST API

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that illustrate how to use the [Wattwatchers Rest API](https://docs.wattwatchers.com.au/api/v3/index.html).

The notebooks can either be used 'as is' to download data through the API or as a starting point to learn about the API and write your own code.

To use a notebook, open the notebook file in Github and click the 'Open in Colab' button at top of the file. This will open the notebook in Google Colab, where you can run and edit the code.
